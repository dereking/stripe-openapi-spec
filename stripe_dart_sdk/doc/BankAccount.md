## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**account** | [**BankAccountAccount**](BankAccountAccount.md) |  | [optional] 
**accountHolderName** | **String** | The name of the person or business that owns the bank account. | [optional] 
**accountHolderType** | **String** | The type of entity that holds the account. This can be either `individual` or `company`. | [optional] 
**accountType** | **String** | The bank account type. This can only be `checking` or `savings` in most countries. In Japan, this can only be `futsu` or `toza`. | [optional] 
**availablePayoutMethods** | **List<String>** | A set of available payout methods for this bank account. Only values from this set should be passed as the `method` when creating a payout. | [optional] [default to const []]
**bankName** | **String** | Name of the bank associated with the routing number (e.g., `WELLS FARGO`). | [optional] 
**country** | **String** | Two-letter ISO code representing the country the bank account is located in. | 
**currency** | **String** | Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts) paid out to the bank account. | 
**customer** | [**BankAccountCustomer**](BankAccountCustomer.md) |  | [optional] 
**defaultForCurrency** | **bool** | Whether this bank account is the default external account for its currency. | [optional] 
**fingerprint** | **String** | Uniquely identifies this particular bank account. You can use this attribute to check whether two bank accounts are the same. | [optional] 
**futureRequirements** | [**ExternalAccountRequirements**](ExternalAccountRequirements.md) |  | [optional] 
**id** | **String** | Unique identifier for the object. | 
**last4** | **String** | The last four digits of the bank account number. | 
**metadata** | **Map<String, String>** | Set of [key-value pairs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. | [optional] [default to const {}]
**object** | **String** | String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. | 
**requirements** | [**ExternalAccountRequirements**](ExternalAccountRequirements.md) |  | [optional] 
**routingNumber** | **String** | The routing transit number for the bank account. | [optional] 
**status** | **String** | For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) until the bank details are updated.  For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`. If a payout fails, the status is set to `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details are updated. In the US and India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. |
