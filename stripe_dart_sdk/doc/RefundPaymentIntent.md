**amount** | **int** | Amount intended to be collected by this PaymentIntent. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge Â¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99). | [optional]

Make sure that you have TLS enabled on any page that includes the client secret.  Refer to our docs to [accept a payment](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?ui=elements) and learn about how `client_secret` should be handled. | [optional] 
**confirmationMethod** | **String** | Describes whether we can confirm this PaymentIntent automatically, or if it requires customer action to confirm the payment. | [optional] 
**created** | **int** | Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. |

**lastPaymentError** | [**ApiErrors**](ApiErrors.md) |  | [optional] 
**latestCharge** | [**PaymentIntentLatestCharge**](PaymentIntentLatestCharge.md) |  | [optional] 
**livemode** | **bool** | Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode. | 
**metadata** | **BuiltMap&lt;String, String&gt;** | Set of [key-value pairs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Learn more about [storing information in metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents/creating-payment-intents#storing-information-in-metadata). | [optional] 
**nextAction** | [**PaymentIntentNextAction**](PaymentIntentNextAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**object** | **String** | String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. | 
**onBehalfOf** | [**PaymentIntentOnBehalfOf**](PaymentIntentOnBehalfOf.md) |  | [optional] 
**paymentMethod** | [**PaymentIntentPaymentMethod**](PaymentIntentPaymentMethod.md) |  | [optional] 
**paymentMethodConfigurationDetails** | [**PaymentMethodConfigBizPaymentMethodConfigurationDetails**](PaymentMethodConfigBizPaymentMethodConfigurationDetails.md) |  | [optional] 
**paymentMethodOptions** | [**PaymentIntentPaymentMethodOptions**](PaymentIntentPaymentMethodOptions.md) |  | [optional] 
**paymentMethodTypes** | **BuiltList&lt;String&gt;** | The list of payment method types (e.g. card) that this PaymentIntent is allowed to use. A comprehensive list of valid payment method types can be found [here](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type). | [optional] 
**presentmentDetails** | [**PaymentFlowsPaymentIntentPresentmentDetails**](PaymentFlowsPaymentIntentPresentmentDetails.md) |  | [optional] 
**processing** | [**PaymentIntentProcessing**](PaymentIntentProcessing.md) |  | [optional] 
**receiptEmail** | **String** | Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to. If `receipt_email` is specified for a payment in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails). | [optional] 
**review** | [**PaymentIntentReview**](PaymentIntentReview.md) |  | [optional] 
**setupFutureUsage** | **String** | Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent's payment method.  If you provide a Customer with the PaymentIntent, you can use this parameter to [attach the payment method](/payments/save-during-payment) to the Customer after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and the customer completes any required actions. If you don't provide a Customer, you can still [attach](/api/payment_methods/attach) the payment method to a Customer after the transaction completes.  If the payment method is `card_present` and isn't a digital wallet, Stripe creates and attaches a [generated_card](/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card to the Customer instead.  When processing card payments, Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to help you comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](/strong-customer-authentication). | [optional] 
**shipping** | [**Shipping**](Shipping.md) |  | [optional] 
**statementDescriptor** | **String** | Text that appears on the customer's statement as the statement descriptor for a non-card charge. This value overrides the account's default statement descriptor. For information about requirements, including the 22-character limit, see [the Statement Descriptor docs](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).  Setting this value for a card charge returns an error. For card charges, set the [statement_descriptor_suffix](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic) instead. | [optional] 
**statementDescriptorSuffix** | **String** | Provides information about a card charge. Concatenated to the account's [statement descriptor prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#static) to form the complete statement descriptor that appears on the customer's statement. | [optional] 
**status** | **String** | Status of this PaymentIntent, one of `requires_payment_method`, `requires_confirmation`, `requires_action`, `processing`, `requires_capture`, `canceled`, or `succeeded`. Read more about each PaymentIntent [status](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses). | 
**transferData** | [**TransferData**](TransferData.md) |  | [optional] 
**transferGroup** | **String** | A string that identifies the resulting payment as part of a group. Learn more about the [use case for connected accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers). | [optional]
