/// * [expiresAfterDays] - The number of calendar days before a Boleto voucher expires. For example, if you create a Boleto voucher on Monday and you set expires_after_days to 2, the Boleto voucher will expire on Wednesday at 23:59 America/Sao_Paulo time.
/// * [setupFutureUsage] - Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent's payment method.  If you provide a Customer with the PaymentIntent, you can use this parameter to [attach the payment method](/payments/save-during-payment) to the Customer after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and the customer completes any required actions. If you don't provide a Customer, you can still [attach](/api/payment_methods/attach) the payment method to a Customer after the transaction completes.  If the payment method is `card_present` and isn't a digital wallet, Stripe creates and attaches a [generated_card](/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card to the Customer instead.  When processing card payments, Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to help you comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](/strong-customer-authentication).
