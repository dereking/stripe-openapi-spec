Mobile banking apps display it as the name of the business. To use custom branding, set the Bacs Direct Debit Display Name during or right after creation. Custom branding incurs an additional monthly fee for the platform. The fee appears 5 business days after requesting Bacs. If you don't set the display name before requesting Bacs capability, it's automatically set as \"Stripe\" and the account is onboarded to Stripe branding, which is free.
